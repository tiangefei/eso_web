          <h3>Social Media Disclosure</h3>
          <p>
            ESOTERICA’s social media accounts are run by individual analysts or
            other ESOTERICA team members. Social media posts are not necessarily
            the opinion of ESOTERICA. As an investor, ESOTERICA and its related
            persons, use conversations via social media as part of its
            investment research process. As a result, ESOTERICA and clients as
            well as its related persons such as Qindong Liu may (but do not
            necessarily) have financial interests in securities or issuers that
            we discuss. However, any discussion of securities or issuers by
            ESOTERICA or Qindong Liu in such conversations is not a
            recommendation to buy, sell or hold any particular security.{" "}

            service, or the offer to sell or the solicitation of an offer to buy
            any security; nor shall any such services be provided, or securities
            be offered or sold, in any jurisdiction in which such an offer,

            is subject to applicable statutes and regulations. This Site is
            published in the United States for residents of the United States.
            Investors outside of the United States are subject to securities and
            tax regulations within their applicable jurisdictions that are not
            addressed on this Site. U.S. investors are advised that not all
            investments or services described on this Site are available for
            sale in all states. Any potential investor should satisfy himself
            that an investment in an ESOTERICA product is permissible under the
            rules and regulations of his or her domicile. The Site is not
            directed to any person in any jurisdiction where (by reason of that
            person’s nationality, residence or otherwise) the publication or

            The information provided is for informational purposes only. It does
            not constitute any form of advice or recommendation to buy or sell
            any securities or adopt any investment strategy mentioned. It is
            intended only to provide observations and views of the author(s) at
            the time of writing, both of which are subject to change at any time
            without prior notice. The information provided does not have regard
            to the specific investment objectives, financial situation or
            particular needs of any specific person who may read it, and
            investors should determine for themselves whether a particular
            service or product is suitable for their investment needs or should
            seek such professional advice for their particular situation. Please
            refer to offering documents for further information concerning
            specific products.
          </p>
          <p>
            Any reference to a particular company or security is not an
            endorsement by ESOTERICA of that company or security or a
            recommendation by ESOTERICA to purchase or sell such security. For a
            list of all purchases and sales made by ESOTERICA for client
            accounts during the past year that could be considered by the SEC as
            recommendations, click here. It should not be assumed that
            recommendations made in the future will be profitable or will equal
            the performance of the securities in this list.
          </p>
          <p>
            Certain of the statements contained herein may be statements of
            future expectations and other forward-looking statements that are
            based on ESOTERICA’s current views and assumptions and involve known
            and unknown risks and uncertainties that could cause actual results,
            performance or events to differ materially from those expressed or
            implied in such statements. In addition to statements which are
            forward-looking by reason of context, the words “may, will, should,
            expects, plans, intends, anticipates, believes, estimates, predicts,
            potential, or continue” and similar expressions identify
            forward-looking statements.
          </p>
          <p>
            The matters discussed herein may also involve risks and
            uncertainties described from time to time in ESOTERICA’s filings
            with the U.S. Securities and Exchange Commission. The company
            assumes no obligation to update any forward-looking information
            contained herein.

          <p>
            As an investor, ESOTERICA and its related persons uses online
            activity as part of its investment research process. As a result,
            ESOTERICA and clients as well as its related persons may (but do not
            necessarily) have financial interests in securities or issuers that
            we discuss. However, any discussion of securities or issuers by
            ESOTERICA in such conversations is not a recommendation to buy, sell
            or hold any particular security.
          </p>
          <h3>Investments</h3>
          <p>
            Past performance is no guarantee of future results. Equities may
            decline in value due to both real and perceived general market,
            economic, and industry conditions. The value of investments, and the
            income from them, can go down as well as up, and you may not recover
            the amount of your original investment. Any tax benefits referred to
            on this Site are subject to change and their availability and value
            will depend on your individual circumstance. Such investments are
            not deposits or obligations of, or guaranteed or endorsed by, any
            bank, and are not federally insured or guaranteed by the U.S.
            government, the FDIC, the Federal Reserve Board or any other agency.
            Some ESOTERICA products may not be available in or appropriate for a
            retirement savings plan. Please contact your financial adviser about
            any investment restrictions associated with your particular plan.
          </p>
          <h3>No Reliance</h3>

            information contained within this Site is accurate, no
            representation or warranty (including liability towards third

            partners. Opinions and any other Content are provided by ESOTERICA

          <p>
            Neither ESOTERICA nor any of their respective affiliates, directors,

          <p>
            Where applicable law does not permit the limitation of liability,
            implied warranties or the exclusion or limitation of certain damages
            set forth above, the aggregate liability of ESOTERICA shall not
            exceed fifty dollars ($50).
          </p>
          <h3>Indemnification</h3>
          <p>
            You hereby indemnify, defend, and hold ESOTERICA and any of their
            respective affiliates, directors, officers, registered
            representatives or employees, nor any third party vendor harmless
            from and against any and all liabilities, judgments, fines, damages,
            settlements and costs (including reasonable attorneys’ fees and

          <h3>Linked Sites</h3>
          <p>
            Certain hyperlinks or referenced websites on the Site may for your

            and are provided or maintained by third parties over whom ESOTERICA
            exercises no control. ESOTERICA expressly disclaims any

          <p>
            In the event that any provision of these terms is held
            unenforceable, the validity or enforceability of the remaining
            provisions will not be affected, and the unenforceable provision
            will be replaced with an enforceable provision that comes close to
