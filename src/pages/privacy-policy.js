          <p>This Privacy Notice was last updated May 08, 2020</p>
          <p>
            This Privacy Notice applies to personal data collected on our
            website
            <a href="https://esotericacap.com/"> esotericacap.com</a>{" "}
            (“Website”). This Privacy Notice sets out the categories of personal
            data we collect from you, how we collect it, what we use it for and
            with whom we share it in accordance with the General Data Protection
            Regulation (EU) 2016/679 (“GDPR”). For the purposes of this Privacy
            Notice, “ESOTERICA”, “we”, “us”, and “our” means Esoterica Capital
            LLC and Esoterica Thematic Trust.
          </p>
          <p>
            By “personal data” we mean any information relating to you such as
            your name, contact details, taxpayer identification number, account
            number, account balance and transaction information or online
            identifiers such as your IP address. Personal data does not include
            data where you can no longer be identified from it such as
            anonymized aggregate data.
          </p>
          <p>
            ESOTERICA is a data controller. This means that we are responsible
            for deciding how we hold and use personal data about you. If you
            have any questions about this Privacy Notice or how we handle your
            personal data, please contact us at info@esotericacap.com.
          </p>
          <p>
            This Privacy Notice applies to personal data about you that we
            collect, use and otherwise process in connection with your
            relationship with us as a user of the Website.
          </p>
          <p>
            We may provide supplemental privacy notices on specific occasions
            when we are collecting or processing personal data about you so that
            you are fully aware of how and why we are using your personal data.
            Those supplemental notices should be read together with this Privacy
            Notice.

          <h3>
            What personal data do we collect about you and what do we use it
            for?
          </h3>
          <p>
            The categories of personal data about you which we may collect,
            store and use are set out in the table below and in each case we
            have indicated what we use your personal data for and our ‘lawful
            basis’ for processing it. The law specifies certain ‘lawful bases’
            under which we are allowed to use your personal data. Most commonly,
            we will rely on one or more of the following lawful bases for
            processing your personal data: Where we need to comply with a legal
            obligation;
          </p>
          <p>
            Where it is necessary for our legitimate interests (or those of a
            third party) and your interests and fundamental rights do not
            override those interests; and/or
          </p>
          <p>Where we have obtained your consent.</p>
          <p>
            We may rely on your consent as a lawful basis for processing your
            personal data. You have the right to withdraw consent at any time by
            contacting us at the details given at the beginning of this notice.
          </p>
          <img src={table} alt="" />
          <p>
            We also collect, use and share aggregated data such as statistical
            or demographic data for any purpose. Aggregated data may be derived
            from your personal data but is not considered personal data itself
            as it can no longer be used to identify you. For example, we may
            aggregate your browsing information data to calculate the percentage
            of our users interested in a specific product type. However, if we
            combine or connect aggregated data with your personal data so that
            it can be used to identify you, we treat the combined data as
            personal data which will be used in accordance with this Privacy
            Notice.
          </p>
          <p>
            Please note that we may process your personal data without your
            knowledge or consent, in compliance with the above rules, if we are
            required by law to do so or if we reasonably believe that it is
            necessary to protect our rights and/or to comply with judicial or
            regulatory proceedings, a court order or other legal process.
          </p>
          <h3>How do we collect your personal data?</h3>

            Our marketing service provider, who combines data you provide on our
            Website with other publicly available data about you, such as your
            social media account information
          </p>
          <h3>With whom do we share your personal data?</h3>
          <p>
            We may share your personal data with third parties where this is
            required by law, where you have consented, or where we have another
            legitimate interest in doing so.
          </p>
          <p>We may share your personal data with:</p>
          <p>

          </p>
          <p>
            A regulator or government entity if we are required by law to do so
            or if we reasonably believe that disclosure is necessary to protect
            our rights and/or to comply with judicial or regulatory proceedings,
            a court order or other legal process
          </p>
          <h3>What if you do not provide the personal data we request?</h3>
          <p>
            If you do not provide us with certain personal data when requested,
            we may not be able to provide you with the services or products you
            have requested.
          </p>
          <h3>Change of purpose</h3>
          <p>
            We will only use your personal data for the purposes for which we
            collected it (as identified above in the What we use this personal
            data for column), unless we reasonably consider that we need to use
            it for another reason which is compatible with the original purpose
            for which you provided it to us. If we need to use your personal
            data for a purpose that is unrelated to the original purpose for
            which you provided it to us, we will notify you and we will explain
            the legal basis which allows us to do so.
          </p>
          <h3>“Do Not Track” Signals</h3>
          <p>
            Some web browsers may transmit “do not track” signals to the Website
            and other online services with which the browser communicates. There
            is no standard that governs what, if anything, Website should do
            when they receive these signals. We currently do not take action in
            response to these signals. If and when a standard for responding is
            established, we may revisit our policy on responding to these
            signals.
          </p>
          <h3>Processing of your personal data outside the EEA</h3>
          <p>
            Esoterica Capital LLC and Esoterica Thematic Trust are U.S.
            organizations that do not have affiliates or offices in the EU. Our
            marketing partners and sales affiliates are also U.S. organizations
            that do not have affiliates or offices in the EU.
          </p>
          <p>
            The personal data we collect about you will be transferred directly
            by you to us, our service providers or our sales affiliates outside
            of the EEA. It is therefore necessary for us to process your
            personal data outside of the EEA for the performance of our contract
            with you. We have put in place physical, electronic and procedural
            safeguards that are reasonably designed to protect your personal
            data from unauthorized access and use in order to ensure that your
            personal data is treated in a manner that is consistent with and
            which respects the EU laws on data protection. If you require
            further information about the transfer of your personal data outside
            of the EEA, you can request it from info@esotericacap.com.
          </p>
          <h3>How long will we retain your personal data?</h3>
          <p>
            We will only retain your personal data for as long as necessary to
            fulfill the purposes we collected it for, including for the purposes
            of satisfying any legal, regulatory, accounting or reporting
            requirements.
          </p>
          <p>
            To determine the appropriate retention period for personal data, we
            consider the amount, nature, and sensitivity of the personal data,
            the potential risk of harm from unauthorised use or disclosure of
            your personal data, the purposes for which we process your personal
            data and whether we can achieve those purposes through other means,
            and the applicable legal requirements.
          </p>
          <p>
            In some circumstances, we may anonymize your personal data so that
            it can no longer be associated with you, in which case it is no
            longer personal data.
          </p>
          <p>
            Once we no longer require your personal data for the purposes we
            collected it for, we will securely destroy your personal data in
            accordance with applicable laws and regulations.
          </p>
          <h3>Accuracy of personal data</h3>
          <p>
            It is important that the personal data we hold about you is accurate
            and current. Please let us know if your personal data changes during
            your relationship with us.
          </p>
          <h3>Your rights in relation to your personal data</h3>
          <p>
            You have rights as an individual which you can exercise in relation
            to the information we hold about you under certain circumstances.
            These rights are to:
            <br />
            Request access to your personal data (commonly known as a “data
            subject access request”) and request certain information in relation
            to its processing;
            <br />
            Request rectification of your personal data;
            <br />
            Request the erasure of your personal data;
            <br />
            Request the restriction of processing of your personal data;
            <br />
            Object to the processing of your personal data;
            <br />
            Request the transfer of your personal data to another party.
            <br />
            If you want to exercise any of these rights please contact us at
            info@esotericacap.com.
            <br />
          </p>
          <p>
            You also have the right to make a complaint at any time to an EU
            data protection authority (“DPA”). However, it is possible that we
            could resolve your concerns directly if you contact us first, so
            please consider doing so.
          </p>
          <p>
            While we strive to protect all information we receive from you, we
            cannot guarantee the security of any information you transmit to us.
          </p>
          <h3>Fees</h3>
          <p>
            You will not usually have to pay a fee to access your personal data
            (or to exercise any of the other rights). However, we may charge a
            reasonable fee if your request for access is manifestly unfounded or
            excessive. Alternatively, we may refuse to comply with the request
            in such circumstances.
          </p>
          <h3>What we may need from you</h3>
          <p>
            We may need to request specific information from you to help us
            confirm your identity and ensure your right to access the
            information (or to exercise any of your other rights). This is
            another appropriate security measure to ensure that personal data is
            not disclosed to any person who has no right to receive it.
          </p>
          <h3>Your right to withdraw your consent</h3>
          <p>
            In the limited circumstances where you may have provided your
            consent to the collection, processing and transfer of your personal
            data for a specific purpose, you have the right to withdraw your
            consent for that specific processing at any time. To withdraw your
            consent, please contact us at info@esotericacap.com or update your
            marketing profile by clicking the preference link in one of
            ESOTERICA’s marketing emails. Once we have received notification
            that you have withdrawn your consent, we will no longer process your
            information for the purpose(s) you originally agreed to unless we
            otherwise have an alternative legal basis for doing so.
          </p>
          <h3>Changes to this privacy notice</h3>
          <p>
            We reserve the right to update this privacy notice at any time, and
            we will make an updated copy of such privacy notice available on our
            Website and notify you when we make any substantial updates. We may
            also notify you in other ways from time to time about the processing
            of your personal data.
          </p>
          <h2>Additional Information</h2>
          <h3>Data Security</h3>
          <p>
            We have implemented measures that are reasonably designed to secure
            your personal data from accidental loss and from unauthorized
            access, use, alteration and disclosure.
          </p>
          <h3>Children Under the Age of 13</h3>
          <p>
            Our Website are not intended for children under 13 years of age. No
            one under age 13 may provide any personal data to or on the Website.
            We do not knowingly collect personal data from children under 13. If
            you are under 13, do not use or provide any information on the
            Website or on or through any of its features/register on the

            telephone number, e-mail address or any screen name or user name you
            may use. If we learn we have collected or received personal data
            from a child under 13 without verification of parental consent, we
            will delete that information. If you believe we might have any
            information from or about a child under 13, please contact us at
            info@esotericacap.com.
          </p>
          <h3>California Privacy Rights</h3>
          <p>
            If you are a California resident, you may have certain additional
            rights. California Civil Code Section 1798.83 permits you to request
            information regarding the disclosure of your personal data by us to
            third parties for the third parties’ direct marketing purposes. To
            make such a request, please write, call or send an email to the
            below contact information.

            This Privacy Notice was written with brevity and clarity in mind and
            is not an exhaustive account of all aspects of our collection and
