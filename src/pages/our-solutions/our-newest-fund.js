                  5G is much more than an upgrade to wireless cellular networks;
                  5G accelerates global digital transformation. We believe that
                  value creation goes far beyond carriers – notwithstanding what
                  their public pronouncements may imply. Value resides with the
                  transformative technologies that are creating a new generation
                  of semiconductors that power 5G and other advanced computing
                  needs; a new cloud computing architecture that’s moving to the
                  edge to optimize the benefits of faster speed, low latency,
                  and massive capacity; software to filter and process vast
                  quantities of data in real-time; and, enabling technologies
                  such as streaming, smart homes, smart factories, remote
                  healthcare, autonomous vehicles, AR/VR - and applications that
                  have yet-to-be-created. 4G was foundational to mobile internet
                  that has transformed our lives; 5G is digitalizing our economy
                  at every level.

                  Our investment process is underpinned by fundamental research,
                  conducted by analysts on the ground in the U.S. and Asia – the
                  two leading regions in the 5G race. Our investment approach is
                  both “top-down” to identify the above-mentioned sectors and
                  “bottom-up”, to identify companies that are attractively
                  valued and well-positioned. Technologies leveraging the next
                  generation of connectivity are fast-evolving, and the
                  perception of investors ever-changing (and often
                  misunderstood), such that actively rotating between the
                  sectors (and therefore companies) is a meaningful source of
                  returns.

                    <strong>How to capture the 5G opportunity? </strong>
                    First, think globally – 4G was largely U.S. focused; 5G
                    adoption will be global from the outset. Second, think
                    top-down – allocate dynamically to “5G sectors” described
                    below, as technology evolves. Third, think bottom-up –
                    invest in fundamentally superior companies within each “5G
                    sector”.
                  </li>
                  <li>
                    <strong>
                      5G is not a light-switch; it is an evolution.
                    </strong>{" "}
                    We categorize the impact of 5G technology in four main
                    categories/sectors: (1) New Semiconductors, (2) Cloud & Edge
                    Computing, (3) SaaS & (4) Enabling Technology. We invest in
                    all of these “sectors,” with allocations adjusted in-line
                    with the development of the 5G cycle.
