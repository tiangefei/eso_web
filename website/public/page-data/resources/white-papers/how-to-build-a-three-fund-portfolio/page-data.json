It is essentially an updated version of the classic 60/40 stock-bond portfolio.

In short, the 3-fund passive approach is a proven way for investors to build wealth, and experience a much smoother ride in the process. Market capitalization-weighted index funds are shunned by stock-pickers, but scientific research shows few active money managers and/or hedge funds have actually been able to consistently outperform. The historical effectiveness of the simple 3-fund approach, combined with its low costs and low time commitment, make it a suitable consideration for the core-holdings of all investors.","nodeType":"text"}],"nodeType":"paragraph"},{"data":{"target":{"sys":{"space":{"sys":{"type":"Link","linkType":"Space","id":"ibuw5oxk16h9","contentful_id":"ibuw5oxk16h9"}},"id":"fzTzFIRuknXzWZcaBZKQN","type":"Asset","createdAt":"2020-07-09T13:57:30.886Z","updatedAt":"2020-07-09T13:57:30.886Z","environment":{"sys":{"id":"master","type":"Link","linkType":"Environment","contentful_id":"master"}},"revision":1,"contentful_id":"fzTzFIRuknXzWZcaBZKQN"},"fields":{"title":{"en-US":"60-40 portfolio"},"description":{"en-US":"60/40 portfolio has been hard to beat"},"file":{"en-US":{"url":"//images.ctfassets.net/ibuw5oxk16h9/fzTzFIRuknXzWZcaBZKQN/dc11877fffed21acd922302ac594a13c/image.png","details":{"size":68765,"image":{"width":624,"height":321}},"fileName":"image.png","contentType":"image/png"}}}}},"content":[],"nodeType":"embedded-asset-block"},{"data":{},"content":[{"data":{},"marks":[{"type":"bold"}],"value":"3.

There is another huge advantage that many overlook; the passive cap-weighted indices evolve in response to structural shifts/changes. For example, increased “green” policies-and-attitudes have resulted in a consistent decline in the Energy sector weight within the S&P 500, while the ever-growing digital economy trend is reflected in a consistent increase in the Tech sector weight. The demographic shift, in the average age of the U.S. consumer, can also be seen in the expanding size of the Health Care sector weight.","nodeType":"text"}],"nodeType":"paragraph"},{"data":{},"content":[{"data":{},"marks":[],"value":"The biggest disadvantage of the 3-fund approach is that it is not sexy.
