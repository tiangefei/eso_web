Under the new licensing model, one license will cover up to 32 cores in a single CPU. If a CPU has more than 32 cores, another license will be required. So for anyone buying server CPU to run virtual-machine, you’ll have to buy 2 licenses from VMware if you use AMD’s high-end 64-core products vs only 1 if you are using Intel.
