But this latest move by Epic brought the fight up to another level.\n\nIn the case of Netflix and Spotify, both companies stopped making in-app subscription an option, and users must go to their websites to subscribe. They are not directly violating App Store policy since the purchase does not happen in the apps; therefore, both apps are still available in the App Store. Users can download the app but need an extra trip to the website to subscribe and use the service. Netflix and Spotify can pull this off thanks to 1) their dominating position in video/music streaming and large user base, and 2) new users only need to make that extra subscription effort once. By doing this, both companies can still distribute their apps through the App Store and get away from paying the “Apple Tax.”\n\nFor a game like Fortnite, this is likely much harder: the game does have a vast user base, over 350 million registered payers to be precise. However, in-app purchases happen much more frequently, and asking gamers to go to its website every time is not a viable option. ","nodeType":"text"},{"data":{"uri":"https://techcrunch.com/2020/08/14/facebook-vs-apple/"},"content":[{"data":{},"marks":[],"value":"Facebook also decided to join the growing list","nodeType":"text"}],"nodeType":"hyperlink"},{"data":{},"marks":[],"value":" of developers to publicly criticize Apple’s policy of in-app purchases, right after rolling out a paid event feature in the Facebook app on Friday.\n\nNow you have the world’s largest video streaming platform, music streaming platform, gaming franchise, and social network, all publicly attacking Apple’s highest-margin business.
