Hermann Hauser, the co-founder of ARM, expressed that idea in a recent interview: \"One of the ARM business model's fundamental assumptions is that it can sell to everyone. If it becomes part of Nvidia, most of the licensees are competitors of Nvidia and will, of course, then look for an alternative to ARM.\" While Nvidia is an ARM licensee, it mostly uses ARM core design in its Tegra SoC for the automotive and game console, and no business in the smartphone market. However, if one particular semiconductor designer owns ARM, even it's not directly competing with most of the customers, it still introduces a significant conflict of interest.","nodeType":"text"}],"nodeType":"paragraph"},{"data":{},"content":[{"data":{},"marks":[],"value":"","nodeType":"text"},{"data":{"uri":"https://www.theverge.com/2016/9/5/12798302/softbank-arm-acquisition-complete"},"content":[{"data":{},"marks":[],"value":"Softbank bought ARM in 2016 for $32 billion","nodeType":"text"}],"nodeType":"hyperlink"},{"data":{},"marks":[],"value":" and has increased spending and headcounts by a meaningful amount since the purchase.
