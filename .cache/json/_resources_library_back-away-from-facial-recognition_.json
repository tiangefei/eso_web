The competitive landscape in facial recognition include new computer vision companies (SenseTime, Megvii, Yitu, and CloudWalk) and traditional surveillance providers (HikVision, Dahua, and UNView). Tech Giant Tencent began testing facial recognition in games as part of anti-addiction measures for minors, and a total of 80 games under Tencent will implement new anti-addiction regulations by the end of May 2020. Among the main competitors in the facial recognition field in China, SenseTime, Megvii, Yiyu, CloudWalk, HikeVition, and Dahua are all on the Entity List by the U.S. Department of Commerce. It means the companies are subject to specific license requirements for the export of certain items, and any transaction with the company listed on the Entity List is seen as a “red flag” by the U.S. government. The facial recognition products from China will not be able to enter the U.S. market, while the U.S. tech giants are backing away from facial recognition. It is uncertain if it will create a gap for smaller facial recognition companies in the U.S. to take over the market share given the temporary lack of tech giants and regulations in the facial\nrecognition field.","nodeType":"text"}],"nodeType":"paragraph"}],"nodeType":"document"}},"publishDate":"June 15th, 2020","heroImage":{"fluid":{"base64":"data:image/jpeg;base64,/9j/4AAQSkZJRgABAQEAlgCWAAD/2wBDAA0JCgsKCA0LCgsODg0PEyAVExISEyccHhcgLikxMC4pLSwzOko+MzZGNywtQFdBRkxOUlNSMj5aYVpQYEpRUk//2wBDAQ4ODhMREyYVFSZPNS01T09PT09PT09PT09PT09PT09PT09PT09PT09PT09PT09PT09PT09PT09PT09PT09PT0//wAARCAAKABQDASIAAhEBAxEB/8QAGAAAAgMAAAAAAAAAAAAAAAAAAAIBAwT/xAAkEAACAgACCwAAAAAAAAAAAAAAAQIEAwUREiEiIzEyQXFywf/EABcBAAMBAAAAAAAAAAAAAAAAAAABAwT/xAAVEQEBAAAAAAAAAAAAAAAAAAAAAf/aAAwDAQACEQMRAD8ARd9qZhy647axoOLTwp6uloeu+PY9/iJq9c/CM69Wygk92MQGfMBh/9k=","aspectRatio":2,"src":"//images.ctfassets.net/ibuw5oxk16h9/5EKan8rSVYer7kLTEVgcDV/b2a985ae0cabf24997b503a83b57ec0b/esoterica_blog-images_2x1__11_of_100_.jpg?w=1440&q=50&bg=rgb%3A000000","srcSet":"//images.ctfassets.net/ibuw5oxk16h9/5EKan8rSVYer7kLTEVgcDV/b2a985ae0cabf24997b503a83b57ec0b/esoterica_blog-images_2x1__11_of_100_.jpg?w=360&h=180&q=50&bg=rgb%3A000000 360w,\n//images.ctfassets.net/ibuw5oxk16h9/5EKan8rSVYer7kLTEVgcDV/b2a985ae0cabf24997b503a83b57ec0b/esoterica_blog-images_2x1__11_of_100_.jpg?w=720&h=360&q=50&bg=rgb%3A000000 720w,\n//images.ctfassets.net/ibuw5oxk16h9/5EKan8rSVYer7kLTEVgcDV/b2a985ae0cabf24997b503a83b57ec0b/esoterica_blog-images_2x1__11_of_100_.jpg?w=1440&h=720&q=50&bg=rgb%3A000000 1440w,\n//images.ctfassets.net/ibuw5oxk16h9/5EKan8rSVYer7kLTEVgcDV/b2a985ae0cabf24997b503a83b57ec0b/esoterica_blog-images_2x1__11_of_100_.jpg?w=2160&h=1080&q=50&bg=rgb%3A000000 2160w,\n//images.ctfassets.net/ibuw5oxk16h9/5EKan8rSVYer7kLTEVgcDV/b2a985ae0cabf24997b503a83b57ec0b/esoterica_blog-images_2x1__11_of_100_.jpg?w=2240&h=1120&q=50&bg=rgb%3A000000 2240w","sizes":"(max-width: 1440px) 100vw, 1440px"}}},"contentfulGlossary":null},"pageContext":{"slug":"back-away-from-facial-recognition","postType":"library"}}
