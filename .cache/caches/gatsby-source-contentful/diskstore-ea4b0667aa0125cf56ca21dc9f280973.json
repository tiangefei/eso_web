On the smartphone side, Xiaomi, Oppo, and Vivo are all aggressively rolling out 5G smartphones, yet there is no restriction putting on them by the US so far. On the infrastructure side, ZTE is another major telecom equipment provider supporting the aggressive 5G deployment by the carriers. While ZTE was under US sanctions back in 2018 for doing business with Iran, it is mostly back to business as usual after paying the fine and a management overhaul, with no major limit for it buying key components from US suppliers.
